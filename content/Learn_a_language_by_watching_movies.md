# Learn a Language by Watching Your Favorite Movies
Everyone has movies that they know almost all the lines to. Why not use that to your advantage and learn a new language? Watching movies that you know well in another language greatly increases comprehension. You already know the context and can focus more on the language and how it is spoken.

## Watching with English Subtitles
If you are just starting to learn a language, it is a good idea to watch with English subtitles. This way you can follow along with the story and understand what is happening. You can also see how the words are translated and learn new vocabulary.

If it is a movie you truly know all of the lines to, try watching with the subtitles in the language you are learning. This will help you associate the words with the sounds and help you learn the language faster.

## Watching with both audio and subtitles in the language you are learning
Once you are more comfortable with the language, try watching with both the audio and subtitles in the language you are learning. This will help you learn how the words are pronounced and how they are written. It will also help you learn how to read and listen at the same time.

Sometimes the subtitles can differ from the actual words that are spoken. This can give you an idea as to how the same concept can be expressed in different ways.

## Watch it repeatedly
If it is a movie you love, watching it repeatedly will be less painful, and you will pick up on more and more of the language each time. You will start to recognize words and phrases and understand how they are used in context.

You will start to predict each line in your mind, just as you would in your native language.

## Conclusion
Watching movies in another language is a fun and effective way to learn a new language. You can learn new vocabulary, improve your listening skills, and learn how to read and listen at the same time. So grab your favorite movie and start learning a new language today!
