# Learn a Language by Watching Your Favorite Movies
Everyone has a handful of movies that they know almost all of the lines to. Why not use that to your advantage when learning a new language? Watching movies that you know very well in another language increases comprehension greatly. You are already aware of the context and can focus more on the language and how it is spoken.

## Watching with English Subtitles
If you are just starting out with the language, it may be a good idea to watch with English subtitles. This way you can still follow along with what is being expressed. You can also see how the words are translated and learn new vocabulary.

## Watching with both audio and subtitles in the language you are learning
If you selected a movie that you know almost every line to, try watching with both the audio and the subtitles in the language you are learning. This will help you learn how the words are pronounced and how they are written.

Sometimes the subtitles can differ from the spoken words. This can give you an idea as to how the same concept can be expressed in different ways.

## Watch it repeatedly
If it is a movie you love, watching it repeatedly should be painless. Each time, you will pick up on more and more of the language. You will start to recognize words and phrases and understand how they are used in context.

You will even start to predict words and phrases before they are uttered, just as you would in your native language.

## Conclusion
Watching movies in another language is a fun and effective way to learn a new language. You can learn new vocabulary, improve your listening skills, and learn different ways to express the same ideas. So grab some popcorn and your favorite movie and start learning a new language today!
